Ginga is the first step of the CAPOEIRA to bring one step closer personalised oncology. Ginga is a pipeline base on state of the art genomic tools that are seemlesly integrated in a single streamline pipeline.
Ginga translates whole exome sequencing (WES) data from patients into a library of specific neoantigens with the goal to create a personalised therapy that its effective at targeting uniquely the cancer cells.
